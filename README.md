# SteppedProgressBar

This is a stepped progressbar for a better elegant way of showing steps in a chain of events, special thanks to [ABSteppedProgressBar](https://github.com/antoninbiret/ABSteppedProgressBar) and [FlexibleSteppedProgressBar](https://github.com/amratab/FlexibleSteppedProgressBar) for their inspirations/solutions, however they weren't customizable enough and sometimes confusing for my needs, so I decided to take this chance to learn about framework developing and cocoapods, publishing this.
